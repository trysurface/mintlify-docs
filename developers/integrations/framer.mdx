1. In your Framer project, click on "Insert" to add a new component
2. Search for "Form" in the components list and add it to your page
3. Configure the form fields according to your needs (name, email, etc.)

</Frame>

### 2. Get Surface Webhook URL

1. Log in to your Surface account
2. Navigate to Leads Hub from the sidebar
3. Click on the "Configure" tab
4. Locate the "Lead Submission Endpoint" section
5. Copy the webhook URL from the cURL command provided

</Frame>

### 3. Match Field Names

Ensure that the input field names in your Framer form match the field names expected by Surface Leads Hub:

| Surface Lead Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `email` | Required field for the lead's email address |
| `firstName` | Lead's first name |
| `lastName` | Lead's last name |
| `company` | Lead's company name |
| `numberOfEmployees` | Company size |
| `title` | Lead's job title |
| `phone` | Lead's phone number |
| `bookedMeeting` | Meeting status |
| `linkedin` | LinkedIn profile URL |
| `companyRevenue` | Company's revenue information |

To set field names in Framer:
1. Select each form input field
2. In the properties panel, find the "Name" property
3. Set the name to match the corresponding Surface lead field (e.g., "email", "firstName")

### 5. Test the Integration

2. Fill out and submit the form with test data
3. Go to your Surface Leads Hub and check the leads table to verify that the submission was received correctly

### Troubleshooting

If your form submissions are not appearing in Surface Leads Hub:

1. Verify that the webhook URL is correct
2. Check that the form field names match the expected Surface lead field names
3. Ensure your form is properly configured to send data to the webhook
4. Try submitting the form again and refresh your Surface Leads Hub
