### 1. Create a new Surface Form

Create a new form using our no code [form builder](https://app.withsurface.com) and copy the form sharing link. You can also [follow this](../quick-start/create-first-form) tutorial to create a basic Surface Form. <br/> For this tutorial suppose its https://forms.withsurface.com/s/cm2jrdp7o0001jv03ui09zrgy

</Accordion>

### 2. Create a new React.js app

Create a new React.js app using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app reactjs-surface-form
```

### 3. Embed the Surface Form

1. Using iFrame

   ```HTML
   <iframe
       id="surface-iframe"
       src="<your_form_link>"
       frameborder="0"
       allowfullscreen>
   </iframe>
   ```

2. Using script (Recommended)

   - Go to `public/index.html` file in your React.js project and add the following code at the end of `<body>` tag:
   
   ```html
   <!-- Start of Surface Tag -->
   <script
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_tag.min.js"
      type="application/javascript"
    ></script>
    <!-- End of Surface Tag -->
    
    <script>
      window.onload = function () {
        const surface_src = "your_form_url";
        const surface_embed_type = ""; // "popup" or "inline"
        const target_element_class = ""; // "surface-form-button" for popup or "surface-form-target for inline"
        const c = new SurfaceEmbed(
          surface_src,
          surface_embed_type,
          target_element_class
        );
        c.popupSize = ""; // "small", "medium", "large"
        c.embedSurfaceForm();
      };
    </script>
    ```

    - Replace `your_form_url` with the form sharing link you copied in step 1.
    - Replace `surface_embed_type` with `"popup"` if you want to show the form as a popup or `"inline"` if you want to show the form inline.
    - Replace `target_element_class` with `"surface-form-button"` if you want to show the form as a popup or `"surface-form-target"` if you want to show the form inline.
    - Replace `popupSize` with `"small"`, `"medium"`, or `"large"` if you want to set the size of the popup form.

### 4. Add className to the target element

Add `surface-form-button` class to the HTML element if you want to show the form as a popup or `surface-form-target` class to the target element if you want to show the form inline.

```jsx
<button className="surface-form-button">Open Form</button>
```

### 5. All done!

You have successfully integrated Surface Forms with your React.js application. You can now embed forms in your React.js application.
