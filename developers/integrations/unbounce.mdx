## Prerequisites

- An active Unbounce account
- A published Surface Form & Unbounce landing page

## Integration Steps

### 1. Access Your Unbounce Page

1. Log in to your Unbounce account
2. Navigate to your landing pages
3. Select the page you want to edit
4. Click "Edit Page" to enter the editor

### 2. Add Surface Tag & Form Script

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/integrations/unbounce/1.png" />
</Frame>

1. In the bottom toolbar, click the "JavaScript" button
2. Click "Add New JavaScript"
3. Add the following script:

<Note>
    Check out the [How to Get Site ID](../../surface-tag/how-to-get-site-id) page to get your site ID.
</Note>

```javascript
<!-- Start Surface Tag -->
<script 
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_tag.js"
    siteId="YOUR_SITE_ID"> // Replace with your site ID
</script>
<!-- End Surface Tag -->


<!-- Start Surface Form Embed -->
<script>
    let surfaceInitialized = false;

    function initializeSurfaceForm() {
        if (surfaceInitialized || typeof SurfaceEmbed === "undefined") return;
        surfaceInitialized = true;

        const surface_src = "SURFACE_FORM_URL"; // Replace with your Surface form URL
        const surface_embed_type = "popup";
        const surface_target_element_class = "surface-form-button";

        const cSurfaceForm = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, surface_target_element_class);
        cSurfaceForm.popupSize = "medium";
      
      	cSurfaceForm.embedSurfaceForm();
    }

    // Run initializeSurfaceForm only when user interacts
    document.addEventListener("click", initializeSurfaceForm, { once: true });
    document.addEventListener("scroll", initializeSurfaceForm, { once: true });
</script>
<!-- End Surface Form Embed -->

```
4. Make sure to replace the `SURFACE_FORM_URL` with your Surface form URL
5. Set the script placement to "Before the body Tag"
6. Click "Done" to save the changes

### 3. Configure Form Trigger Button

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/integrations/unbounce/3.png" />
</Frame>

1. Select any button on your page where you want the Surface form to appear
2. In the sidebar, scroll to the bottom
3. Under "Element Metadata", set the class to `surface-form-button`

## Trigger via Email Input Submission

You can also trigger the Surface form when users submit an Unbounce form. Here's how to set it up:

<Accordion title="Click to see where to find the question ID in the Surface Form Builder">
    <img className="block" src="/images/embed/question_id.png" alt="Screenshot showing where to retrieve the question ID in the Surface Form Builder" />
</Accordion>

### 1. Update the Surface Form Script

Add the `data-question-id` attribute to your Surface form script
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/integrations/unbounce/2.png" />
</Frame>

### 2. Configure Unbounce Form

1. In your Unbounce page editor, add a form element
2. Select the form's submit button
3. In the sidebar, under "Element Metadata", add the class `surface-form-button`

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/integrations/unbounce/3.png" />
</Frame>

Now, when users submit the Unbounce form, the Surface form will appear in a popup.

## Send Unbounce Form Data to Surface Leads using Webhooks

You can automatically send form submissions from Unbounce to Surface Leads using webhooks. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Access Unbounce Webhook Settings

1. Log in to your Unbounce account
2. Select your project page
3. Navigate to the "Integration" tab
4. Click on "Add webhook" in the webhooks section

### 2. Get Surface Webhook URL

1. Log in to your Surface account
2. Navigate to Leads Hub from the sidebar
3. Click on the "Configure" tab
4. Locate the "Lead Submission Endpoint" section
5. Copy the webhook URL from the cURL command provided

</Frame>

### 3. Configure Webhook in Unbounce

1. Return to the Unbounce webhook configuration page
2. Paste the Surface webhook URL you copied
3. Set the Request Type to "JSON"
4. Under "Map Fields", match your Unbounce form fields to Surface lead fields:
   - Map email field to `email`
   - Map first name to `firstName`
   - Map last name to `lastName`
   - Map company name to `company`
   - Map other relevant fields according to your form structure

    <img src="/images/integrations/unbounce/5.png" height="500" width="500" alt="Surface Leads Hub Configuration" />
</Frame>

### Available Surface Lead Fields

You can map Unbounce form fields to any of these Surface lead properties:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `email` | Required field for the lead's email address |
| `firstName` | Lead's first name |
| `lastName` | Lead's last name |
| `company` | Lead's company name |
| `numberOfEmployees` | Company size |
| `title` | Lead's job title |
| `phone` | Lead's phone number |
| `bookedMeeting` | Meeting status |
| `linkedin` | LinkedIn profile URL |
| `companyRevenue` | Company's revenue information |

### Testing the Integration

After setting up the webhook:
1. Submit a test form on your Unbounce page
2. Check the Surface Leads Hub to verify the lead data is being received
3. Review the webhook logs in Unbounce to troubleshoot any issues

## Customization

You can customize the integration by:

- Changing the `popupSize` value to "small", "medium", or "large"
- Modifying the `surface_target_element_class` to match your preferred class name
- Updating the `surface_src` URL to point to your specific Surface form

## Troubleshooting

If the form doesn't appear:

1. Verify that both scripts are properly added and placed before the body tag
2. Check that the button has the correct class name (`surface-form-button`)
3. Ensure your Surface form URL and question ID are correct
4. Check the browser console for any error messages
