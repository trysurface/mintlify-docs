### Add Surface Tag to your website (if you haven't already)

Before setting up email input field submission, ensure you have added the Surface tag to your website. If you haven't already done so, add the following script tag to your website's HTML:

```javascript
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/trysurface/scripts@latest/surface_tag.min.js"
  type="application/javascript"
></script>
```



For detailed instructions on implementing the Surface tag and its configuration options, see our [Surface Tag documentation](../../surface-tag/overview).

### Connect Surface Form to External Email Input

To enable triggering a Surface Form popup from a form field containing an email input, follow these instructions:

1. **Add the HTML Form**: Ensure your HTML form includes the `surface-form-handler` class. This class is essential for identifying the form as one that triggers the Surface Form popup. Example:

   ```html
   <form class="surface-form-handler">
     <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

   > **Note:** You can use both [Surface Form Popup](/developers/surface-forms/popup-slideover) and Surface Form Email Trigger together.

2. **Initialize the Surface Form**: Add the following JavaScript to the page's `head` tag after the above scripts to initialize the Surface Form, validate the email field, and trigger the Surface Form popup. 

   > **Note:** You must replace the `<question_id>` within `params` below with the question ID from the Surface Form Builder.

        <Accordion title="Click to see where to find the question ID in the Surface Form Builder">
        <img className="block" src="/images/embed/question_id.png" alt="Screenshot showing where to retrieve the question ID in the Surface Form Builder" />
        </Accordion>

    ```javascript
    <script>
      const surface_src =
        "[SURFACE_FORM_URL]"; // Replace with your Surface Form URL

      const surface_embed_type = "input-trigger";
      const surface_target_element_class = "surface-form-button";

      const cSurfaceForm = new SurfaceEmbed(
        surface_src,
        surface_embed_type,
        surface_target_element_class,
        {
          emailKey: "[SURFACE_FORM_QUESTION_ID]_emailAddress", // Replace with your Surface Form Question ID
        }
      );

      // Can be "small", "medium", or "large"
      cSurfaceForm.popupSize = "small";
      cSurfaceForm.embedSurfaceForm();


    </script>
    ```

  

3. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - **Email Validation**: Ensures that the email field is not empty and matches a stricter email format.
   - **Triggering the Surface Form Popup**: When the form is submitted with a valid email, the `c.showSurfaceForm()` function is called with the email parameter.
   - **Keyboard Support**: The form handles the "Enter" key to ensure consistent behavior for submitting the form.

4. **Test Your Integration**:
   - Enter a valid email in the input field and press "Submit" or hit "Enter".
   - Verify that the Surface Form popup is displayed as expected.

Now you should be able to trigger a Surface Form popup from an external email input field!
