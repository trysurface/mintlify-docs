## Connect Surface Form to External Email Input

To enable triggering a Surface Form popup from a form field containing an email input, follow these instructions:

<Warning icon="lightbulb">
  Make sure that you have added the [Surface Tag](/surface-tag/quick-start) to your site before proceeding.
</Warning>

### 1. Add the HTML Form 
Ensure your HTML form includes the `surface-form-handler` class. This class is essential for identifying the form as one that triggers the Surface Form popup. Example:

   ```html
   <form class="surface-form-handler">
     <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

   > **Note:** Add the `surface-form-handler` class to any external form that you want to use to trigger the Surface Form popup.

### 2. Modify the Surface Form Embedding Script
Modify the Surface Form Embedding Script to include the `data-question-id` attribute. 

   > **Note:** You must replace the `<question_id>` within `data-question-id` attribute below with the question ID from the Surface Form Builder.

        <Accordion title="Click to see where to find the question ID in the Surface Form Builder">
        <Frame>
        <img className="block" src="/images/embed/question_id.png" alt="Screenshot showing where to retrieve the question ID in the Surface Form Builder" />
        </Frame>
        </Accordion>

   ```HTML
   <script data-question-id="<question_id>">
      window.onload = function () {
        const surface_src = "surface_form_url";
        const surface_embed_type = "slideover"; // works on all embedding types!
        const target_element_class = "surface-form-button";
        const c = new SurfaceEmbed(
          surface_src,
          surface_embed_type,
          target_element_class,
        );
      };
  </script>
   ```

### 3. Test Your Integration
   - Enter a valid email in the input field and press "Submit" or hit "Enter".
   - Verify that the Surface Form popup is displayed as expected.

Now you should be able to trigger a Surface Form popup from an external email input field!
