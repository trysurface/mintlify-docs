<Warning icon="lightbulb">
  Make sure that you have added the [Surface Tag](/surface-tag/implementation) to your site before proceeding.
</Warning>


### Edit Head Tag

Add the following code snippet to your site's `head` tag to enable the slideover form.

```HTML
<!-- Start Surface Form Embed -->
<script>
window.onload = function() {
    const surface_src = "<form url here>"
    const surface_embed_type = "slideover"
    const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
    const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)
}
</script>
<!-- End of Surface Form Embed -->
```

Replace the `<form url here>` with the url to your surface form found by clicking the share button on the surface platform.

### Choose trigger buttons

The next step is to choose which buttons you'd like to trigger the form.

This is done by simply adding the class name `surface-form-button` to the elements which should be able to make the form appear.

```HTML
<button class="... surface-form-button"> </button>
```
