API keys are required to authenticate requests to the Surface API. Each API key is scoped to your environment and provides access to all resources within that environment.

## Creating an API Key

</Frame>

1. Log in to your Surface account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
3. Click on **+ Add API Key**.
4. Give your key a name and click **Create**.
5. **Copy and note down the API key** immediately, as it won't be shown again.

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once when created. Make sure to save your API key securely. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for all API requests:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'https://forms.withsurface.com/api/v1/responses' \
  -H 'x-api-key: your-api-key-here'
```
</CodeGroup>
