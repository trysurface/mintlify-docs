Surface Forms can push key events to your website's data layer, making it easy to track user interactions and conversions in Google Tag Manager (GTM).

<Info>
Learn more about Surface events in our [**events documentation**](/docs/events/form-events).
</Info>

## Overview of Surface Form Events

Surface Forms push three key events to the data layer:

| **Event Name** | **When Fired** | Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`SurfaceFormStarted`** | When the form is started | (None) |
| **`SurfaceFormStepSubmitted`** | When a step is submitted (e.g., email entered) | `emailProvided`, `meetingBooked` , `url` and `urlParams`  |
| **`SurfaceFormSubmitEvent`** | When the entire form is submitted | (None) |

## 1. Set Up Data Layer Variables in GTM

To capture metadata from `SurfaceFormStepSubmitted`, create the following `Data Layer Variables`  in GTM:

| **Variable Name** | **Variable Type** | **Data Layer Variable Name** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dlv - emailProvided | Data Layer Variable | **`emailProvided`** |
| dlv - meetingBooked | Data Layer Variable | **`meetingBooked`** |
| dlv - urlParam | Data Layer Variable (Object) | `urlParam` |
| dlv - url | Data Layer Variable | `url` |

**Steps:**

1. In GTM, go to **Variables**.
2. Click **New** â†’ Choose **Data Layer Variable**.

3. Enter the exact name (e.g., **`dlv - emailProvided`**) and set the Data Layer Variable Name to **`emailProvided`**. Make sure to capitalize the p in `emailProvided` !

4. Repeat for **`meetingBooked`, `url`**  and **`urlParams`.**
    
    <Info>
    `urlParams` is an object, we need to use dot notation e.g. `{{ urlParams.medium }}` to get the data.

## 2. Create Triggers Based on Events

You can now setup triggers that can reference the variables we just created.

| **Trigger Name** | **Trigger Type** | **Event Name** | **Additional Condition** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger - Email Submitted | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | dlv - emailProvided equals true |
| Trigger - Meeting Booked | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | dlv - meetingBooked equals true |
| Trigger - URL | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | Any |
| Trigger - urlParam | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | Any |

## 3. Set Up Google Ads Conversion Tags

Finally, in order to send conversion data to your analytics platform or ads (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc) you must configure a new tag that references the triggers we just created. For example, here are the steps to setup a corresponding Google Ads Conversion Tag. This allows you to track different conversion points with the right conversion action in Google Ads.

| **Tag Name** | **Conversion Action (in Ads)** | **Firing Trigger** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GAds - Form Started | Form Started | Trigger - Form Started |
| GAds - Email Submitted | Email Submitted | Trigger - Email Submitted |
| GAds - Meeting Booked | Meeting Booked | Trigger - Meeting Booked |
| GAds - Form Completed | Form Completed | Trigger - Form Completed |

For more details on how to setup Google Ads Conversion Tags, please refer to our [**Google Ads Tracking Guide**](/docs/events/google-ads-tracking).

<Info>
**Tip:** Make sure your Google Ads account has conversion actions that match these names or your chosen naming convention.
