Create a custom multi-step form or use the starter template.

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone -b demo https://github.com/trysurface/multi-step-progressive-form
    ```
    
2. Open the project and review the **`index.html`** file.

<Frame>
![Multi-step Form Example 1](/images/external-form/4.png)
</Frame>

**Add the form ID to the `<form>` tag**

```html
<form data-id="<Your_Form_ID>">
  <!-- Form steps here -->
</form>
```

Replace **`<Your_Form_ID>`** with the ID of the external form created in Surface Labs.
