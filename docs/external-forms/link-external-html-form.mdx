## Step 1: Add the `SurfaceExternalForm` script to your site

To ensure that the Surface Tag tracks the correct site, the `siteId` attribute must be added to the `SurfaceExternalForm` script.

Get your `siteId` by going to `Settings` > `Overview` :

<Frame>
![Site ID Location](/images/site-id.png)
</Frame>

**Embed the script in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` tag**

<Info>
The script must be added before the closing **`</body>`** tag and replace **`SITE_ID`** with the site ID.
</Info>

```html
<!-- Before the closing </body> tag -->
<script siteId="SITE_ID">
  const surfaceExternalForm = new SurfaceExternalForm();
  surfaceExternalForm.attachFormHandlers();
</script>
```

## Step 2: Create an external form in Surface

### Create a new form in Surface Labs

<Frame>

</Frame>

1. Log in to the [**Surface Labs account**](https://app.surfacelabs.com/).
2. Navigate to the Forms section.
3. Click "Create New Form".
4. Select "Link External Form".

### Add required fields

When linking an external form, all fields that need to be tracked in Surface Forms must be added. The form builder provides several field types to match the form's structure:

<Frame>
![Add Form Fields](/images/external-form/2.png)
</Frame>

### Available field types

- **Identity Info**: Collects personal information like name, email, or phone number.
- **Short Input**: For short text responses (single line).
- **Long Input**: For longer text responses (multi-line).
- **Dropdown**: For selection from predefined options.
- **Multiple Choice**: For radio button or checkbox selections.

Once all fields have been added, they will be ready to map to the external form using the question IDs provided in the next steps.

### Get integration details

After creating the form and adding all fields, the Component Question IDs for each form field must be obtained.

## Step 3: Create a multi-step HTML form

Either create a custom multi-step form or use the starter template.

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone -b demo https://github.com/trysurface/multi-step-progressive-form
    ```
    
2. Open the project and review the **`index.html`** file.

<Frame>
![Multi-step Form Example 1](/images/external-form/4.png)
</Frame>

<Frame>
![Multi-step Form Example 2](/images/site-id.png)
</Frame>

**Add the form ID to the `<form>` tag**

```html
<form data-id="<Your_Form_ID>">
  <!-- Form steps here -->
</form>
```

Replace **`<Your_Form_ID>`** with the ID of the external form created in Surface Labs.

### Add question IDs to form fields

Each field in the form requires a corresponding question ID from Surface Labs to be added to the `data-id` attribute:

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="email">Business email</label>
  <input
    data-id="<Component_Question_ID>"
    type="email"
    id="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="john@telnyx.com"
    required
  />
</div>
```

Replace **`<Component_Question_ID>`** with the question ID obtained while adding components to the external form.

### Add the surface-submit-button class to the submit button

Add the `surface-submit-button` class to the submit button.

```html
<button type="submit" class="surface-submit-button">Submit</button>
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues are encountered:

1. **Form submissions not appearing**:
    - Verify the form ID is correct.
    - Check that question IDs match those in Surface Labs.
    - Ensure the Surface Tag is properly installed.
    - Ensure the submit button has the **`surface-submit-button`** class.

2. **Partial responses not tracking**:
    - Ensure that each 'Next' button has the **`surface-next-button`** class.
    - Check the network tab to confirm requests are being sent.

3. **Script not working**:
    - Verify the script has the **`defer`** attribute if added to the **`<head>`** tag.
    - Check the browser console for errors.
