After creating the External Form and adding all fields in [Step 2](/docs/external-forms/create-external-form), the Component Question IDs for each form field must be obtained.

### Add question IDs to form fields

Each field in the form requires a corresponding question ID from Surface Labs to be added to the `data-id` attribute in the Multi-Step HTML Form:

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="email">Business email</label>
  <input
    data-id="<Component_Question_ID>"
    type="email"
    id="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="john@telnyx.com"
    required
  />
</div>
```

Replace **`<Component_Question_ID>`** with the question ID obtained while adding components to the external form in [Step 2](/docs/external-forms/create-external-form).
