<Note> This feature is only available for popup and slideover forms. </Note>

Users can open the form by directly navigating to your website and appending the `showSurfaceForm=true` query parameter to the URL.

For example:
```
https://withsurface.com/?showSurfaceForm=true
```

This will automatically trigger the form to appear when the page loads, without requiring the user to click a trigger button.
