import SurfaceTagWarning from '/snippets/surface-tag-warning.mdx';


<SurfaceTagWarning />

## iFrame Embed Code

Add the following code wherever you'd like the form to appear:

```html
<!-- Start Surface Form Embed -->

<iframe
  src="REPLACE ME WITH FORM URL"
  allowfullscreen
  loading="eager"
  fetchpriority="high"
 >
</iframe>

<!-- End of Surface Form Embed -->
```

Replace `REPLACE ME WITH FORM URL` with your actual Surface form URL. You can find this URL by clicking the "Share" button in the `Overview` section of the form.

## Optimize Speed

Add the following `<link>` tags inside the `<head>` of your site:

```html
<!-- Speed up connections to forms.withsurface.com by performing early DNS resolution and TCP handshake -->
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://forms.withsurface.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://forms.withsurface.com" crossorigin>

<!--  Fetch the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it. -->
<link rel="prefetch" href="REPLACE ME WITH FORM URL" as="document">
```

<Info>
Replace `REPLACE ME WITH FORM URL` with a Surface Form URL.
</Info>

## Explanation

1. dns-prefetch → Resolves the domain early to skip DNS lookup delays.
2. preconnect → Prepares the TCP + TLS handshake so the browser is ready to request assets immediately.
3. prefetch → Fetches the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it.
