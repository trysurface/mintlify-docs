# Connect Surface Form to External Email Input

To enable triggering a Surface Form popup from a form field containing an email input, follow these instructions:

<Warning>
Make sure that you have added the [**Surface Tag**](/home/surface-tag) to your site before proceeding.
</Warning>

## 1. Add the HTML Form

Ensure your HTML form includes the `surface-form-handler` class. This class is essential for identifying the form as one that triggers the Surface Form popup. Example:

```html
<form class="surface-form-handler">
  <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

<Note>
Add the **`surface-form-handler`** class to any external form that you want to use to trigger the Surface Form popup.
</Note>

## 2. Modify the Surface Form Embedding Script

Modify the Surface Form Embedding Script to include the `data-question-id` attribute.

<Note>
You must replace the **`<question_id>`** within **`data-question-id`** attribute below with the question ID from the Surface Form Builder.
</Note>

<Frame>
![Question ID Location](/images/embed/question_id.png)
</Frame>

```html
<!-- Start Surface Form Embed -->

<script data-question-id="<question_id>">
   window.onload = function () {
     const surface_src = "surface_form_url";
     const surface_embed_type = "slideover"; // works on all embedding types!
     const target_element_class = "surface-form-button";
     const c = new SurfaceEmbed(
       surface_src,
       surface_embed_type,
       target_element_class,
     );
   };
</script>

<!-- End Surface Form Embed -->
```

## 3. Test Your Integration

- Enter a valid email in the input field and press "Submit" or hit "Enter".
- Verify that the Surface Form popup is displayed as expected.

Now you should be able to trigger a Surface Form popup from an external email input field!

## Optimize Speed

Add the following `<link>` tags inside the `<head>` of your site:

```html
<!-- Speed up connections to forms.withsurface.com by performing early DNS resolution and TCP handshake -->
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://forms.withsurface.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://forms.withsurface.com" crossorigin>

<!--  Fetch the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it. -->
<link rel="prefetch" href="FORM_URL" as="document">
```

<Info>
Replace `FORM_URL` with Surface Form URL.
</Info>

## Explanation

1. dns-prefetch → Resolves the domain early to skip DNS lookup delays.
2. preconnect → Prepares the TCP + TLS handshake so the browser is ready to request assets immediately.
3. prefetch → Fetches the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it.
