Surface Forms are designed to load quickly, but you can further reduce latency by instructing the browser to prepare connections to [forms.withsurface.com](http://forms.withsurface.com/) ahead of time. 

This ensures your forms appear almost instantly when triggered.

## How to Optimize

Add the following `<link>` tags inside the `<head>` of your site:

```html
<!-- Speed up connections to forms.withsurface.com by performing early DNS resolution and TCP handshake -->
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://forms.withsurface.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://forms.withsurface.com" crossorigin>

<!--  Fetch the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it. -->
<link rel="prefetch" href="FORM_URL" as="document">
```

<Info>
Replace `FORM_URL` with Surface Form URL.
</Info>

## Explanation

1. dns-prefetch → Resolves the domain early to skip DNS lookup delays.
2. preconnect → Prepares the TCP + TLS handshake so the browser is ready to request assets immediately.
3. prefetch → Fetches the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it.
