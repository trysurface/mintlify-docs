<Warning>
Make sure that you have added the [**Surface Tag**](/home/surface-tag) to your site before proceeding.
</Warning>

## Edit Head Tag

Add the following code snippet to your site's `head` tag to enable the popup form.

```html
<!-- Start Surface Form Embed -->

<script>
window.onload = function() {
    const surface_src = "<form url here>"
    const surface_embed_type = "popup"
    const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
    const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)
}
</script>

<!-- End of Surface Form Embed -->
```

Replace the **`<form url here>`** with the url to your surface form found by clicking the share button on the surface platform.

## Choose trigger buttons

The next step is to choose which buttons you'd like to trigger the form. This is done by simply adding the class name `surface-form-button` to the elements which should be able to make the form appear.

```html
<button class="... surface-form-button"> </button>
```

## Control Popup Size

You can control the size of the popup that appears on your site. See the following snippet:

```html
<!-- Start Surface Form Embed -->

<script>
window.onload = function() {
        const surface_src = "<form url here>"
        const surface_embed_type = "popup"
        const target_element_class = "surface-form-button"
        const c = new SurfaceEmbed(surface_src, surface_embed_type, target_element_class)

        c.popupSize = "medium" // This value can be "small", "medium", or "large"
}
</script>

<!-- End of Surface Form Embed -->
```

## Optimize Speed

Add the following `<link>` tags inside the `<head>` of your site:

```html
<!-- Speed up connections to forms.withsurface.com by performing early DNS resolution and TCP handshake -->
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://forms.withsurface.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://forms.withsurface.com" crossorigin>

<!--  Fetch the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it. -->
<link rel="prefetch" href="FORM_URL" as="document">
```

<Info>
Replace `FORM_URL` with Surface Form URL.
</Info>

## Explanation

1. dns-prefetch → Resolves the domain early to skip DNS lookup delays.
2. preconnect → Prepares the TCP + TLS handshake so the browser is ready to request assets immediately.
3. prefetch → Fetches the form in advance, so it's ready when a user opens it.
