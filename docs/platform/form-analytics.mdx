## Quick Stats

At the top of the page, you'll find a snapshot of your form's performance:

- **Completed** → Number of users who fully submitted the form.
- **Partial** → Number of users who started but did not finish.
- **Total** → Total number of responses (Completed + Partial).
- **Views** → Number of times the form was viewed.
- **Start to Completion Rate** → Percentage of users who started the form and reached submission.

## Conversion Funnel

This chart shows the **percentage of users who progressed through each stage** of your form funnel:

- **Viewed** → Visitors who loaded the form.
- **Started** → Visitors who began filling it out.
- **Submitted** → Visitors who successfully completed submission.

Use this chart to quickly understand your overall conversion rate.

## Drop-off Analytics

The **Drop-off Analytics** table provides a step-by-step breakdown:

- **Step Views** → Number of visitors who viewed that step.
- **Step Completions** → Number of visitors who successfully completed that step.
- **Drop-off Rate** → Percentage of users who left at that step.

This helps identify which step is causing the highest friction and where improvements are needed.
