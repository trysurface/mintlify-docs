Surface Forms supports **conditional logic** to control how users move through your form. You can decide which step comes next, when to mark a response as completed, or when to stop users from continuing.

## Open the Logic Tab

1. Navigate to your form in the Surface editor.
2. At the top, click on the **Logic** tab.
3. Select the step you want to configure.

### 1. Change the Default Next Step

By default, each step flows to the next one in order. But you can change this:

1. Select a step (e.g., step0).
2. In the right-hand panel, open the **Default next step** dropdown.
3. Choose which step should follow.

This allows you to create **branching flows**, sending users to different paths depending on how your form is structured.

### 2. Mark a Step as a Completion Step

A **Completion Step** ends the form once the user reaches it.

- Toggle on **Completion Step** in the right-hand panel.
- When a user lands on this step, their response is marked as **Completed**, and workflows tied to completions will run.

Use this for your final **Thank You** or **Confirmation** screens.

### 3. Mark a Step as an Invalid Step

An **Invalid Step** blocks the user from progressing further.

- Toggle on **Invalid Step** in the right-hand panel.
- When a user lands here, their response is marked as **Invalid**.
- Invalid responses will **not trigger workflows** and the user cannot move forward.

This is useful for:

- Filtering out unqualified leads
- Handling incorrect inputs
- Blocking progression when conditions aren't met

## Advanced Routing (Routing Rules)

Advanced Routing lets you control how respondents move through your form based on their answers. Instead of a fixed linear flow, you can add logic to skip, branch, or redirect steps dynamically.

### What you can do with Advanced Routing

1. **Add Conditions** – Define rules that check user inputs (e.g., email, company size, budget, etc.).
2. **Use Form Response Data** – Conditions can be applied directly on responses collected in previous steps.
3. **Customize User Paths** – Send users to different steps based on their answers.

### Example

Suppose you want to skip certain users directly to the end of the form based on their email address:

- **Condition**: If the email entered in **Step 0** equals saharsh@withsurface.com
- **Action**: Jump to **Step 2** (Thank you step)
- **Else**: Default path continues to **Step 1**

This way, you can create **personalized form experiences** depending on who is filling out the form.

<Tip>
You can combine multiple conditions using **AND** / **OR** logic to create powerful branching flows.
