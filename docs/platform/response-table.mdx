The **Responses Table** in Surface Forms is your central hub for managing all form submissions. It helps you search, filter, and export responses while giving you deep visibility into every lead through the **Lead Sidebar**.

## Advanced Filtering & Searching

Use the **search bar, filters and sort** to quickly find responses by name, email, company, or any form field.

This makes it easy to narrow down to exactly the leads you want to view or export.

### Partial vs. Completed Responses

- **Completed Responses** (green) → The user fully submitted the form.
- **Partial Responses** (yellow) → The user started the form but did not complete it.

### Exporting Responses

- Export **all responses** (completed + partial) into a CSV file.
- Exports respect your applied filters — so you can, for example, download only completed leads.

## Lead Sidebar

Clicking any response in the table opens the **Lead Sidebar**, which gives you a 360° view of that lead.

### 1. Response Tab

- Shows the detailed information the lead submitted through the form.
- Includes all captured fields like **First Name, Last Name, Email, Company, and other form fields**.

### 2. Person Tab

- Provides enriched context about the lead:
    - **IP address**
    - **Country / Geo-location**
    - **Referrer URL** (where they came from)
    - **Window URL** (page where the form was filled)
    - **Origin** (domain source)

### 3. Workflow Tab

- Displays the **workflow history** triggered by this response.
- Includes:
    - **Executed steps** (e.g., Slack Notification, HubSpot Sync)
    - **Status logs** (success/failure per step)
    - **Error details** (for failed runs)

With the **Responses Table** + **Lead Sidebar**, you can move seamlessly from a high-level view of all submissions to a deep-dive into each individual lead's journey and automation history.
