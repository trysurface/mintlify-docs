Surface's website de-anonymization tool helps you identify anonymous website visitors and enrich them with detailed company and contact information.

## How It Works

3. Reveals visitor identity and company information
4. Enriches visitor profiles with additional data

## Available Information

- LinkedIn Profile

### Company Details

- Revenue Range

## Implementation

The de-anonymization feature is built into the Surface Tag.
