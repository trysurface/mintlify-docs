A/B testing in Surface Forms allows you to test multiple form variants to optimize conversion rates. Create experiments, track performance metrics, and make data-driven decisions to improve your forms.

## Creating an Experiment

<Steps>
  1. Navigate to the Experiments section
  2. Click "New A/B experiment"
  3. Enter experiment details:
     - Name your experiment
     - Add a description
     - Select form variants
     - Set test duration
  4. Configure traffic distribution
  5. Choose metrics to track
</Steps>

## Form Variants

Add and configure multiple versions of your form:

<Card>
  <ol>
    <li>1. Start with your default form variant</li>
    <li>2. Add additional variants using "+ Add form variant"</li>
    <li>3. Distribute traffic percentage across variants</li>
    <li>4. Total distribution must equal 100%</li>
  </ol>
</Card>

<Note>
  Each variant can have different designs, content, or flow logic while maintaining the same goal for accurate testing.
</Note>

## Traffic Distribution

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Default Variant" icon="square-1">
    Your original form design, typically starting with a higher traffic percentage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Variants" icon="square-plus">
    New versions you want to test against the default, with smaller initial traffic allocations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Performance Metrics

Track two key metrics to measure form performance:

### Conversion Rate
<Card title="Conversion Rate" icon="chart-line">
  Track the percentage of visitors who take the desired action to optimize your form's performance.
  
  <ol>
    <li>1. Measures form completion rate</li>
    <li>2. Shows effectiveness of each variant</li>
    <li>3. Helps identify best-performing designs</li>
  </ol>
</Card>

### Email Collection
<Card title="No. of Emails Collected" icon="envelope">
  Measure the total emails captured to evaluate lead generation effectiveness.
  
  <ol>
    <li>1. Tracks total leads generated</li>
    <li>2. Measures quantity of conversions</li>
    <li>3. Helps assess lead generation impact</li>
  </ol>
</Card>

## Experiment Duration

Set a specific timeframe for your test:

<Card>
  <ol>
    <li>1. Set clear start and end dates</li>
    <li>2. Allow minimum 2 weeks for testing</li>
    <li>3. Factor in your site's traffic volume</li>
    <li>4. Ensure duration allows statistical significance</li>
  </ol>
</Card>

## Monitoring Results

Track your experiment performance:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Live Metrics" icon="gauge">
    <ol>
        <li>1. Conversion rates</li>
        <li>2. Email collection numbers</li>
        <li>3. Form visits</li>
        <li>4. Distribution percentages</li>
    </ol>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Analysis Tools" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    <ol>
        <li>1. Performance comparisons</li>
        <li>2. Statistical significance</li>
        <li>3. Real-time data</li>
        <li>4. Variant insights</li>
    </ol>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices
Testing Tips:
<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Single Focus" icon="bullseye">
    Test one major change at a time
  </Card>

  <Card title="Traffic Volume" icon="users">
    Ensure sufficient traffic for statistical significance
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test Duration" icon="clock">
    Run tests for adequate duration
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Test Elements

Here are some of the form elements you may want to consider modifying as you create your experiments:

- Form layout (Single vs Dual pane)
- Call-to-action text
- Form length
- Field order
- Marketing content
- Visual design
- Form step sequence
