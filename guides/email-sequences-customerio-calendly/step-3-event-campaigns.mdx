In this step, you'll create **two event-triggered campaigns** in Customer.io—one for partial form submissions and one for completed submissions. Each campaign will send a series of follow-up emails with customizable delays between them.

## Create the Partial Submission Campaign

</Frame>

1. In Customer.io, go to **Campaigns** and click **Create Campaign**
2. Click **Event** as the trigger type
3. Configure the trigger:
   - **Event name**: `partialFormFilled` (must match the event from your partial webhook campaign in Step 1)
   - **Workspace**: Select the workspace where your leads are stored
   - Add any filters if needed (e.g., segment, attribute)


## Build the Email Sequence

Add your follow-up emails and delays to the campaign workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First email">
    Add an **Email** block as the first step. This sends immediately when the person enters the campaign.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delay">
    Add a **Delay** block. Set the delay (e.g., 2 days, 3 days) before the next touchpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calendly check (Step 4)">
    Add a **Send and receive data** (webhook) block that checks Calendly. If the meeting is booked, the person exits. Otherwise, continue. See [Step 4: Calendly Meeting Check](/guides/email-sequences-customerio-calendly/step-4-calendly-check).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second email">
    Add another **Email** block. This sends only if the person didn't book a meeting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Add another **Delay** → **Webhook (Calendly check)** → **Email**. Repeat for as many follow-ups as you want.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create the Completed Submission Campaign

Repeat the same process for completed submissions:

1. Create a new campaign with **Event** trigger
2. Set **Event name**: `formCompleted` (must match the event from your completed webhook campaign in Step 1)
3. Build the same structure: Email → Delay → Calendly check → Email → …
4. Use different copy and timing if you want (e.g., shorter delays for completed submissions, since they're more engaged)

<Tip>
Completed leads are typically warmer, so you might use a shorter, more sales-focused sequence. Partial leads may need more nurturing and clear calls-to-action to book a meeting.
</Tip>

## Save and Activate

1. Review each campaign
2. Click **Start Campaign** for both
3. They will trigger when the corresponding events fire from your webhook campaign

## Next Step

Add the Calendly meeting check (webhook node) before each follow-up email (after the first). This ensures the campaign exits when a lead books a meeting. See [Step 4: Calendly Meeting Check](/guides/email-sequences-customerio-calendly/step-4-calendly-check).
