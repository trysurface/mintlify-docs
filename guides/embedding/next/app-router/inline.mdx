To embed a Surface form inline in your Next.js application, you can use an iframe. This method allows the form to appear as part of your page content.

Add the following code wherever you'd like the form to appear in your Next.js component:

```jsx
<iframe
    id="surface-iframe"
    src="<your_form_url>"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

Replace `<your_form_url>` with your actual Surface Form URL.
