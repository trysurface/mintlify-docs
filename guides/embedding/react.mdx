## Embed the Surface Form

### 1. Using an iFrame directly:

```html
<iframe
    id="surface-iframe"
    src="<your_form_url>"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### 2. Using script (Recommended):


Go to the **`public/index.html`** file in your React.js project and add the following code at the end of **`<body>`** tag:

```html
 <script>
   window.onload = function () {
     const surface_src = "your_form_url";
     const surface_embed_type = "popup"; // "popup" or "slideover"
     const target_element_class = "surface-form-button";
     const c = new SurfaceEmbed(
       surface_src,
       surface_embed_type,
       target_element_class
     );
     c.popupSize = "medium"; // "small", "medium", "large"
   };
 </script>
```

## Add className to the target element

Add **`surface-form-button`** class to the HTML element if you want to show the form as a popup or **`surface-form-target`** class to the target element if you want to show the form inline.

```jsx
<button className="surface-form-button">Open Form</button>
```

## All Done!

You have successfully integrated Surface Forms with your React.js application. You can now embed forms in your React.js application.
