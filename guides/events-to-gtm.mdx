Surface Forms can push key events to your website's data layer, making it easy to track user interactions and conversions in Google Tag Manager (GTM).

<Tip>
    Learn more about Surface events in our [events documentation](/docs/events/form-events).
</Tip>
## Overview of Surface Form Events

Surface Forms push three key events to the data layer:

| Event Name                | When Fired                        | Metadata                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SurfaceFormStarted`     | When the form is started          | (None)                          |
| `SurfaceFormStepSubmitted` | When a step is submitted (e.g., email entered) | `emailProvided`, `meetingBooked` |
| `SurfaceFormSubmitEvent` | When the entire form is submitted | (None)      |
---

## 1. Set Up Data Layer Variables in GTM

To capture metadata from `SurfaceFormStepSubmitted`, create the following `Data Layer Variables` in GTM:

| Variable Name            | Variable Type         | Data Layer Variable Name    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| dlv - emailProvided            | Data Layer Variable   | `emailProvided`             |
| dlv - meetingBooked            | Data Layer Variable   | `meetingBooked`             |

**Steps:**
1. In GTM, go to <b>Variables</b>.
2. Click <b>New</b> â†’ Choose <b>Data Layer Variable</b>.

3. Enter the exact name (e.g., <code>dlv - emailProvided</code>) and set the Data Layer Variable Name to <code>emailProvided</code>.
<img className="block" src="/images/gtm/gtm_13.png" alt="Hero Light" />

4. Repeat for <code>meetingBooked</code>.

## 2. Create Triggers Based on Events

You can now setup triggers that can reference the variables we just created.

| Trigger Name           | Trigger Type | Event Name                | Additional Condition                |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Trigger - Email Submitted | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | dlv - emailProvided equals true     |
| Trigger - Meeting Booked  | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | dlv - meetingBooked equals true     |

<img className="block" src="/images/gtm/gtm_15.png" alt="Hero Light" />

## 3. Set Up Google Ads Conversion Tags

Finally, in order to send conversion data to your analytics platform or ads (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, etc) you must configure a new tag that references the triggers we just created. 

For example, here are the steps to setup a corresponding Google Ads Conversion Tag. This allows you to track different conversion points with the right conversion action in Google Ads.

| Tag Name                | Conversion Action (in Ads) | Firing Trigger           |
|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| GAds - Form Started    | Form Started               | Trigger - Form Started   |
| GAds - Email Submitted | Email Submitted            | Trigger - Email Submitted|
| GAds - Meeting Booked  | Meeting Booked             | Trigger - Meeting Booked |
| GAds - Form Completed  | Form Completed             | Trigger - Form Completed |

For more details on how to setup Google Ads Conversion Tags, please refer to our [Google Ads Tracking Guide](/guides/google-ads-tracking).
