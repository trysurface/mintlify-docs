Surface Forms can push key events to your website's data layer, making it easy to track user interactions and conversions in Google Tag Manager (GTM).

<Tip>
    Learn more about Surface events in our [events documentation](/surface-forms/events).
</Tip>
## 1. Overview of Surface Form Events

Surface Forms push three key events to the data layer:

| Event Name                | When Fired                        | Metadata                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SurfaceFormStarted`     | When the form is started          | (None)                          |
| `SurfaceFormStepSubmitted` | When a step is submitted (e.g., email entered) | `emailProvided`, `meetingBooked` |
| `SurfaceFormSubmitEvent` | When the entire form is submitted | (None)      |

<Card>
  <b>Event Details:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>SurfaceFormStarted</b>: Fired when the user first begins the form.</li>
    <li><b>SurfaceFormStepSubmitted</b>: Fired when a user submits a step. Carries <code>emailProvided</code> and <code>meetingBooked</code> metadata.</li>
    <li><b>SurfaceFormSubmitEvent</b>: Fired when the form is completely submitted. Use to signal a full conversion.</li>
  </ul>
</Card>

## 2. Set Up Data Layer Variables in GTM

To capture metadata from `SurfaceFormStepSubmitted`, create Data Layer Variables in GTM:

| Variable Name            | Variable Type         | Data Layer Variable Name    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| emailProvided            | Data Layer Variable   | `emailProvided`             |
| meetingBooked            | Data Layer Variable   | `meetingBooked`             |

**Steps:**
1. In GTM, go to <b>Variables</b>.
2. Click <b>New</b> → Choose <b>Data Layer Variable</b>.
3. Enter the exact name (e.g., <code>DLV - emailProvided</code>) and set the Data Layer Variable Name to <code>emailProvided</code>.
4. Repeat for <code>meetingBooked</code>.

## 3. Create Triggers Based on Events

You'll use three types of triggers—one for each event type or combination, based on your tracking needs.

### A. Separate Events (No Metadata Needed)

| Trigger Name           | Trigger Type | Event Name              | Conditions         |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Trigger - Form Started| Custom Event | SurfaceFormStarted      | None (fire on event) |
| Trigger - Form Completed| Custom Event | SurfaceFormSubmitEvent | None (fire on event) |

### B. Event with Metadata (SurfaceFormStepSubmitted)

| Trigger Name           | Trigger Type | Event Name                | Additional Condition                |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Trigger - Email Submitted | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | DLV - emailProvided equals true     |
| Trigger - Meeting Booked  | Custom Event | SurfaceFormStepSubmitted | DLV - meetingBooked equals true     |

<Card>
  <b>Example: Email Submitted Trigger</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Event Name: <code>SurfaceFormStepSubmitted</code></li>
    <li>Condition: <code>DLV - emailProvided</code> equals <code>true</code></li>
  </ul>
</Card>

## 4. Set Up Google Ads Conversion Tags

For each trigger, create a corresponding Google Ads Conversion Tag. This lets you track different conversion points with the right conversion action in Google Ads.

| Tag Name                | Conversion Action (in Ads) | Firing Trigger           |
|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| GAds - Form Started    | Form Started               | Trigger - Form Started   |
| GAds - Email Submitted | Email Submitted            | Trigger - Email Submitted|
| GAds - Meeting Booked  | Meeting Booked             | Trigger - Meeting Booked |
| GAds - Form Completed  | Form Completed             | Trigger - Form Completed |

<Card>
  <b>Tip:</b> Make sure your Google Ads account has conversion actions that match these names or your chosen naming convention.
