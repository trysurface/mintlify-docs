## Step 1: Create a Multi-Step HTML Form

You can either create your own multi-step form or use our starter template.

### Option A: Use Our Template

1. Clone our repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trysurface/multi-step-progressive-form
```

2. Open the project and review the HTML structure:
```html
<!-- This is a simplified structure of the template -->
<form id="surfaceForm" class="surface-form-handler">
  <!-- Step 1 -->
  <div class="form-step" data-step="1">
    <input type="text" name="firstName" data-question-id="firstName" required>
    <button type="button" class="next-btn">Next</button>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Step 2 -->
  <div class="form-step" data-step="2">
    <input type="email" name="email" data-question-id="email" required>
    <button type="button" class="prev-btn">Back</button>
    <button type="button" class="next-btn">Next</button>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Final Step -->
  <div class="form-step" data-step="3">
    <textarea name="message" data-question-id="message"></textarea>
    <input type="hidden" name="completed" data-question-id="formCompleted" value="true">
    <button type="button" class="prev-btn">Back</button>
    <button type="submit" class="submit-btn">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

### Option B: Create Your Own Multi-Step Form

If you prefer to build your own form, ensure it has:

1. A container for each step
2. Navigation buttons between steps
3. Input fields for collecting user data
4. A way to track the current step
5. A hidden field to mark completion
6. The `surface-form-handler` class on the form element

## Step 2: Connect Your Form to Surface Labs

### Create a New Form in Surface Labs

1. Log in to your [Surface Labs account](https://app.surfacelabs.com)
2. Navigate to the Forms section
3. Click "Create New Form"
4. Select "External Form Integration"
5. Configure your form settings:
   - You'll need to add all the fields that you want to track.
   - Surface Labs will automatically track the form submission and send the data to your form handler endpoint.

### Get Your Integration Details

After creating your form, you'll need:

1. The form handler endpoint URL
2. Question IDs for each form field

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/embed/question_id.png" alt="Question ID location in Surface Labs dashboard" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Configure Form Submission Endpoint

Update your form to send data to Surface Labs by adding the form handler endpoint:

```html
<form id="surfaceForm" class="surface-form-handler" action="https://api.surfacelabs.com/forms/YOUR_FORM_ID/submit">
  <!-- Your form steps here -->
</form>
```

Alternatively, you can configure this with JavaScript:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const form = document.getElementById('surfaceForm');
  form.action = 'https://api.surfacelabs.com/forms/YOUR_FORM_ID/submit';
});
```

## Step 4: Add Question IDs to Form Fields

Each field in your form needs a corresponding question ID from Surface Labs:

```html
<input type="text" name="firstName" data-question-id="q_abc123" required>
<input type="email" name="email" data-question-id="q_xyz456" required>
<textarea name="message" data-question-id="q_def789"></textarea>
```

For the final step, include a hidden field to mark the form as completed:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="completed" data-question-id="formCompleted" value="true">
```

## Step 5: Verify Your Integration

To ensure your integration is working correctly:

1. **Test Form Submission**:
   - Fill out and submit your form
   - Check your Surface Labs dashboard for the submission

2. **Verify Partial Responses**:
   - Navigate partially through the form
   - Check that partial responses appear in Surface Labs

3. **Test Visitor Tracking**:
   - Visit the page with Surface Tag installed
   - Confirm visitor data appears in the Analytics section

4. **Check Form Analytics**:
   - Review the form analytics in Surface Labs
   - Verify completion rates and drop-off points

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Form submissions not appearing**:
   - Verify your form endpoint URL is correct
   - Check that question IDs match those in Surface Labs
   - Ensure the Surface Tag is properly installed

2. **Partial responses not tracking**:
   - Make sure each step has the proper data-question-id attributes
   - Check your network tab to confirm requests are being sent

3. **Surface Tag not working**:
   - Verify the script is in the `<head>` section
   - Check browser console for errors
