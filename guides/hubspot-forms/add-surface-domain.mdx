<AddSurfaceDomain />

## Why Add This Domain?

Adding `forms.withsurface.com` to HubSpot's Additional Site Domains allows HubSpot to:

- **Track form submissions** from Surface Forms properly
- **Handle cross-domain tracking** correctly
- **Identify visitors** across both your site and Surface Forms
- **Maintain proper analytics** for form interactions

## Next Steps
