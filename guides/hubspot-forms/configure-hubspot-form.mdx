To ensure Surface Forms can submit partial leads to HubSpot without errors, you need to configure your HubSpot form to accept optional fields. Choose the option that best fits your setup.

## Configuration Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Option 1: Duplicate Form"
    icon="copy"
    href="/guides/hubspot-forms/duplicate-form"
  >
    Create a duplicate of your existing HubSpot form with fields marked as optional for partial lead capture
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Option 2: Existing Form"
    icon="edit"
    href="/guides/hubspot-forms/existing-form"
  >
    Add a hidden "partial" status field to your existing form - ideal if you have workflows already connected
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Which Option Should You Choose?

**Choose Option 1: Duplicate Form** if:
- You want to keep your original form unchanged
- You're starting fresh with Surface Forms
- You want separate forms for complete vs. partial submissions
- You prefer clear separation between full and partial lead data

**Choose Option 2: Existing Form** if:
- You have existing workflows connected to your HubSpot form
- You want to use the same form for both complete and partial submissions
- You prefer minimal changes to your current setup
- You want to maintain a single source of truth for form submissions
