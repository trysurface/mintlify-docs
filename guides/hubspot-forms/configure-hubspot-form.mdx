You can **skip this step** if you already have a HubSpot form you want to send submissions to—go straight to [Configure HubSpot in Surface Workflow](/guides/hubspot-forms/configure-workflow) to map your form and set up the sync.

If you need to create or adjust a HubSpot form (for example, to support partial submissions), follow the steps below.

## Access Your HubSpot Form

</Frame>

1. Log in to your **HubSpot** account
2. Navigate to **Marketing** → **Forms**
3. Click on the form you want to modify

## Make Existing Fields Optional (If Needed)

For submissions to work successfully, you may need to make some required fields optional:

1. Click on each field that might be empty in submissions
2. Find the **Required** checkbox or toggle
3. **disable** the Required option for fields that:
   - Are not essential for lead capture
   - May be filled in later stages of the form
   - Are not needed for your workflows

4. **Keep required** any fields that are:
   - Essential for your workflows
   - Needed for contact identification (like email)
   - Required for your business logic

## Best Practices

- **Workflow Testing**: Test workflows with both partial and complete submissions
- **Documentation**: Document which fields are optional and why
- **Monitoring**: Track partial vs. complete submissions to optimize your forms
