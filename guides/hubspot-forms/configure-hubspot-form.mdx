To ensure Surface Forms can submit to HubSpot without errors, you need to configure your HubSpot form. Add a hidden "partial" status field to your existing form to track both complete and partial submissions.

## Step 1: Access Your HubSpot Form

1. Log in to your **HubSpot** account
2. Navigate to **Marketing** → **Lead Capture** → **Forms**
3. Click on the form you want to modify

## Step 2: Add a Hidden Field

</Frame>

1. In your form editor, click **Add field** or the **+** button
2. Select **Hidden field** from the field types
3. If "Hidden field" isn't available, you can:
   - Add a regular field and mark it as hidden in the field settings
   - Or use a custom property field

## Step 3: Configure the Hidden Field

</Frame>

1. Click on the hidden field you just added
2. Configure the field settings:
   - **Field label**: `Partial Lead Status` or `Submission Type`
   - **Internal name**: `partial_lead_status` or `submission_type`
   - **Field type**: Select **Single-line text** or **Dropdown**
   - **Required**: Set to **No** (optional)
   - **Hidden**: Ensure this is set to **Yes** or **Hidden**

3. If using a dropdown:
   - Add options: `complete` and `partial`
   - Set default value to `partial` (optional)

4. Click **Save** or **Apply**

## Step 4: Make Existing Fields Optional (If Needed)

For submissions to work successfully, you may need to make some required fields optional:

1. Click on each field that might be empty in submissions
2. Find the **Required** checkbox or toggle
3. **Uncheck** or **disable** the Required option for fields that:
   - Are not essential for lead capture
   - May be filled in later stages of the form
   - Are not needed for your workflows

4. **Keep required** any fields that are:
   - Essential for your workflows
   - Needed for contact identification (like email)
   - Required for your business logic

## Step 5: Create or Update Custom Property (Optional)

If you want to track submission status in HubSpot contacts:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Properties**
2. Navigate to **Contact properties** (or Company/Deal properties)
3. Click **Create property**
4. Configure:
   - **Label**: `Partial Lead Status`
   - **Internal name**: `partial_lead_status`
   - **Field type**: Single-line text or Dropdown
   - **Group**: Choose an appropriate group
5. Click **Create**

## Best Practices

- **Field Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for your hidden field
- **Workflow Testing**: Test workflows with both partial and complete submissions
- **Documentation**: Document which fields are optional and why
- **Monitoring**: Track partial vs. complete submissions to optimize your forms

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Hidden field not appearing in form response
- **Solution**: Verify the field is properly configured as hidden
- **Solution**: Check that the field name matches in your Surface workflow mapping

**Issue**: Submissions still failing
- **Solution**: Review which fields are still marked as required
- **Solution**: Ensure email or another identifier field remains required if needed for workflows

**Issue**: Workflows not triggering correctly
- **Solution**: Verify the hidden field value is being set correctly
- **Solution**: Check workflow conditions match the field values you're sending
