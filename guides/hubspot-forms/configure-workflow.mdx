After configuring your HubSpot form, you need to set up workflows in Surface to send form submissions to HubSpot. This guide covers connecting HubSpot and configuring the workflow action.

## Connect HubSpot to Surface

1. Click on the **HubSpot Form** dropdown
2. Select the form you want to use for this workflow

### Get Internal Names from HubSpot Form Fields

Before mapping fields, you need to get the **internal names** (also called API names) of your HubSpot form fields. These internal names are what you'll use as the **value** when mapping in Surface workflows.

</Frame>

To find the internal name for each HubSpot form field:

1. In your HubSpot form editor, **select the field** you want to map (e.g., Email or First Name)
2. In the **Edit field** panel on the left, click on **Connected property** (it will show as "Connected" with a green indicator)
3. Under the Connected property section, you'll see the **Internal name** (e.g., `email` or `firstname`)

<Info>
The internal name is different from the field label. For example, a field labeled "Email Address" might have an internal name of `email` or `emailaddress`. Always use the exact internal name shown in the Connected property section.
</Info>


### Map Surface Form fields to HubSpot form fields

Now that you have the internal names from HubSpot, map your Surface Form fields:

1. Click on **Add column** button to add a new field mapping
2. **Key (Surface Field)**: Select the field from your Surface Form
   - Example: `email` from Form Submission or Lead
   - Example: `firstName` from Form Submission or Lead
3. **Value (HubSpot Internal Name)**: Enter the exact internal name you found in HubSpot
   - Example: `email` (from the Email field's Connected property)
   - Example: `firstname` (from the First Name field's Connected property)
4. **HubSpot Field**: Select the corresponding HubSpot form field from the dropdown
   - Example: Email
   - Example: First Name

**Mapping Examples:**

| Surface Field (Key) | HubSpot Internal Name (Value) | HubSpot Field |
|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| `email` (from Form Submission) | `email` | Email |
| `firstName` (from Form Submission) | `firstname` | First Name |

<Warning>
The **Value** field must match the internal name exactly as shown in HubSpot's Connected property section. This is case-sensitive—`email` is different from `Email` or `EMAIL`.
</Warning>

## Configure Additional HubSpot Actions (Optional)

You can add multiple HubSpot actions to your workflow:

- **Create Contact** - Create a new contact in HubSpot
- **Create or Update Contact** - Create or update a contact
- **Create Company** - Create a company record
- **Create Deal** - Create a new deal
- **HubSpot AI Agent** - Use AI to manage contacts and deals automatically
