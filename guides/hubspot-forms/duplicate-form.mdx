This guide walks you through creating a copy of your existing HubSpot form with fields marked as optional. This approach allows Surface Forms to submit partial leads without errors.

## When to Use This Option

This option is ideal if:
- You want to keep your original form unchanged
- You're starting fresh with Surface Forms integration
- You prefer separate forms for complete vs. partial submissions
- You want clear separation between full and partial lead data

## Step 1: Access Your HubSpot Forms

1. Log in to your **HubSpot** account
2. Navigate to **Marketing** → **Forms**

## Step 2: Duplicate Your Form

</Frame>

1. Hover over the form you want to duplicate
2. Click the **clone** option
4. Give your new form a descriptive name, such as:
   - `[Original Form Name] - Partial Leads`
   - `[Original Form Name] - Surface Forms`
   - `[Original Form Name] - Optional Fields`

## Step 3: Mark Fields as Optional

1. In your duplicated form, click on each field to edit it
2. For each field that was previously required:
   - Click the field to open its settings
   - Click on the **More** button
   - Click on the **Make optional** button
   - Click **Save**

3. Repeat this process for all fields that need to accept partial submissions

## Step 4: Disable CAPTCHA (spam prevention)
