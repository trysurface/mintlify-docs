This option is recommended if:
- You have existing workflows connected to your HubSpot form
- You want to use the same form for both complete and partial submissions
- You prefer minimal changes to your current setup
- You want to maintain a single source of truth for form submissions

## Step 1: Access Your HubSpot Form

1. Log in to your **HubSpot** account
2. Navigate to **Marketing** → **Forms**
3. Click on the form you want to modify
