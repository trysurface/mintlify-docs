## Configuration Options

When configuring your HubSpot form, you have two options:

**Option 1: Duplicate Form** - Create a duplicate of your existing HubSpot form with fields marked as optional
- Best if you want to keep your original form unchanged
- Ideal for starting fresh with Surface Forms

**Option 2: Existing Form** - Add a hidden "partial" status field to your existing form
- Best if you have existing workflows connected to your HubSpot form
- Ideal for maintaining a single source of truth
