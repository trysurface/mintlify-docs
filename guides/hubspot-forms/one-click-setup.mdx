The One Click Setup automatically creates HubSpot forms (both complete and partial) and starts sending form submissions to HubSpot. All you need to do is authenticate with HubSpot and enable the sync.

## Step 1: Authenticate with HubSpot

## Step 2: Enable HubSpot Sync

</Frame>

1. Under **HubSpot Connection**, toggle on **Enable HubSpot Sync**
2. Surface will automatically:
   - Create a complete form in HubSpot for finished submissions
   - Create a partial form in HubSpot for incomplete submissions
   - Start syncing form submissions to HubSpot

## What Happens Next?

Once enabled, Surface will:
- **Automatically create forms** in your HubSpot account
- **Sync complete submissions** to the complete form
- **Sync partial submissions** to the partial form
- **Handle field mapping** automatically
