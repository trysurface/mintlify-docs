Surface Forms can capture partial leads when users start filling out your form but don't complete it. To ensure these partial submissions work correctly with HubSpot, you'll need to configure your HubSpot integration.

## Why Configure HubSpot Forms?

When Surface Forms captures partial leads, some required fields in your HubSpot form may be empty. To prevent submission errors, you need to configure your HubSpot form to accept optional fields.
