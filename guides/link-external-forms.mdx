## Step 1: Add `SurfaceExternalForm` script to your site

To ensure that the Surface Tag tracks the correct site, the `siteId` attribute must be added to the `SurfaceExternalForm` script.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/external-form/5.png" />
</Frame>

### Embed the script in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` tag

```html
<!-- For the head tag -->
<script defer siteId="SITE_ID">
  const surfaceExternalForm = new SurfaceExternalForm();
  surfaceExternalForm.attachFormHandlers();
</script>

<!-- OR -->

<!-- For the body tag -->
<script siteId="SITE_ID">
  const surfaceExternalForm = new SurfaceExternalForm();
  surfaceExternalForm.attachFormHandlers();
</script>
```

## Step 2: Create External Form in Surface
### Create a New Form in Surface Labs

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/external-form/1.png" />
</Frame>

1. Log in to the [Surface Labs account](https://app.surfacelabs.com).
2. Navigate to the Forms section.
3. Click "Create New Form".
4. Select "External Form Integration".

### Add Required Fields

When linking an external form, all fields that need to be tracked in Surface Forms must be added. The form builder provides several field types to match the form's structure:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/external-form/2.png" />
</Frame>

### Available Field Types

- **Identity Info**: Collects personal information like name, email, or phone number.
- **Short Input**: For short text responses (single line).
- **Long Input**: For longer text responses (multi-line).
- **Dropdown**: For selection from predefined options.
- **Multiple Choice**: For radio button or checkbox selections.

Once all fields have been added, they will be ready to map to the external form using the question IDs provided in the next steps.

### Get Integration Details

After creating the form and adding all fields, the Component Question IDs for each form field must be obtained.

  <img src="/images/external-form/3.png" alt="Question ID location in Surface Labs dashboard" />
</Frame>

## Step 3: Create a Multi-Step HTML Form

Either create a custom multi-step form or use the starter template.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trysurface/multi-step-progressive-form
```

2. Open the project and review the `index.html` file.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/external-form/4.png" />
</Frame>

### Add Form ID to `<form>` Tag

```html
<form id="demo-form" data-id="<Your_Form_ID>">
  <!-- Form steps here -->
</form>
```

Replace `<Your_Form_ID>` with the ID of the external form created in Surface Labs.

### Add Question IDs to Form Fields

Each field in the form requires a corresponding question ID from Surface Labs to be added to the `data-id` attribute:

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="firstName"><span class="required">*</span> First Name:</label>
  <input data-id="<Component_Question_ID>" type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" placeholder="First Name" class="input-field" required>
</div>
```

Replace `<Component_Question_ID>` with the question ID obtained while adding components to the external form.

### Add `surface-next-button` to Next Buttons

Add the `surface-next-button` class to all next buttons.

```html
<button type="button" class="surface-next-button">Next</button>
```

### Add `surface-submit-button` to Submit Button

Add the `surface-submit-button` class to the submit button.

```html
<button type="submit" class="surface-submit-button">Submit</button>
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues are encountered:

1. **Form submissions not appearing**:
   - Verify the form ID is correct.
   - Check that question IDs match those in Surface Labs.
   - Ensure the Surface Tag is properly installed.
   - Ensure submit button has the `surface-submit-button` class.

2. **Partial responses not tracking**:
   - Ensure that each ‘Next’ button has the `surface-next-button` class.
   - Check the network tab to confirm requests are being sent.

3. **Script not working**:
   - Verify the script has the `defer` attribute if added to the `<head>` tag.
   - Check the browser console for errors.
