Learn how to send Surface Form submissions directly to **HubSpot** using the built-in HubSpot action in the Workflow Builder. You can automatically create or update contacts, companies, deals, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A **Surface** account
- A **HubSpot** account with the right permissions
- Admin access to connect HubSpot to Surface

## Step 1: Connect HubSpot to Surface Forms

1. Open the **Workflow Builder**.
2. Click the **+** button to add a new action node.
3. From the integrations list, choose **HubSpot**.

## Step 2: Choose a HubSpot Action

The HubSpot integration supports multiple actions:

- **Create Contact** → Add a new contact in HubSpot
- **Create or Update Contact** → Add a new contact or update existing ones
- **Create Company** → Create a company record
- **Create Form Response** → Push a form submission directly into HubSpot
- **Create Deal** → Add a new deal in HubSpot
- **Get Owner** → Fetch a HubSpot owner by email
- **HubSpot AI Agent** → Use AI to manage contacts and deals automatically

## Step 3: Configure the HubSpot Action

1. After selecting an action, configure the settings in the right-hand panel.
2. Choose the HubSpot object (e.g., Form, Contact, Company, Deal).
3. Map your Surface Form fields to HubSpot properties:
    - Example: email → Email from Form Submission or Lead
    - Example: firstName → First Name from Form Submission or Lead

## Using the HubSpot AI Agent

The **HubSpot AI Agent** is a powerful option within the HubSpot integration. Instead of manually configuring individual actions (like creating a contact or deal), you can give the AI Agent **instructions in plain English**, and it will take care of managing contacts, companies, and deals in HubSpot.

### Write Instructions for the Agent

In the configuration panel, you'll see a text area labeled **Instructions**.

Here, describe in natural language what you want the AI to do.

For example:

```
Check HubSpot to see if the company exists.  
If the company doesn't exist, create a new company.  
If a contact with the new lead's email doesn't exist, create one.  
Associate the contact with the company.  
If there are no open deals in the "Sales" pipeline, create a new deal and assign it to the company owner.  
```

You can be as detailed as you need - the AI Agent interprets and executes based on HubSpot's API.
