### Advanced Features

#### Using Form Field Data in Search Parameters
You can pass form field data to HubSpot by adding them as search parameters in the scheduler URL. The field names can be found by:
- Checking the platform's documentation
- Inspecting the HTML element to find the field name

This allows you to pre-fill HubSpot fields with data collected in your form.

#### Autoscroll to next step
Surface Form automatically autoscroll to next step when a meeting has been scheduled. It also allows you to:
- Monitor scheduling status
- Create conditional workflows based on scheduling completion
- Track user engagement with the scheduling component
