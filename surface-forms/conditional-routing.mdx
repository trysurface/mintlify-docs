Conditional routing lets you create dynamic form experiences by controlling the flow between steps based on user responses. Enable this by clicking the "Flow" button in the Form Builder navigation bar.

## Understanding Flow Mode

When you enter Flow mode, you'll see:
- Visual representation of your form steps
- Connections between steps showing possible paths
- Routing panel for configuring conditions
- Default paths marked as "default"

## Setting Up Routing

<Steps>
  1. Click the "Flow" button in the navigation bar
  2. Select the step you want to add routing to
  3. Click "+" in the Routing panel to add a condition
  4. Configure your routing logic
  5. Choose the destination step
</Steps>

## Routing Configuration

### Basic Routing
Set up simple conditional paths:

<Card>
  - Select source step
  - Add condition(s)
  - Choose destination step
  - Set default path for when conditions aren't met
</Card>

## Available Operators

When creating conditions, you can use these operators:

  <Card title="Text Operators" icon="text">
    - Equals
    - Not equals
    - Greater than
    - Greater than or equals
    - Less than

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Value Operators" icon="calculator">

    - Number
    - Boolean (T/F)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Condition Types

### Field-Based Conditions
Route based on form field values:
- Text inputs
- Dropdown selections
- Multiple choice answers
- Checkbox states
- Identity information

### Variable-Based Conditions
Use system variables for routing:
- Form completion status
- User attributes
- Enriched data
- Custom variables

## Managing Multiple Conditions

You can add multiple conditions to a single routing rule:

1. Click "+" to add a new condition
2. Choose "And" or "Or" logic between conditions
3. Configure each condition independently
4. Set the destination step for when all conditions are met
