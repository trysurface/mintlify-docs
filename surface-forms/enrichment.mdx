Surface Forms includes powerful built-in enrichment capabilities that automatically enhance your form submissions with detailed company and contact information from our extensive B2B database.

## How It Works

When a visitor submits a form, Surface Forms automatically:
1. Identifies the company and contact based on submitted information
2. Enriches the submission with verified data from our database
3. Delivers the complete profile to your connected destinations
