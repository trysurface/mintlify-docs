To enable Google Tag Manager integration:

1. Navigate to your form settings
2. Click on "Google Tag Manager" section
3. Toggle "Enable google tag manager" switch
4. Enter your GTM ID in the provided field
5. Click "Save"


Once enabled, all Surface Forms events will be automatically sent to your Google Tag Manager account, allowing you to track form interactions and set up custom triggers and tags.

### Event Data

Each event sent to GTM includes relevant data about the form interaction. You can use this data to create detailed analytics and tracking implementations in your GTM setup.

## Using Events

These events can be used to:
- Track form completion rates
- Analyze user drop-off points
- Measure form performance
- Create custom analytics implementations
- Trigger marketing pixels or conversion tracking

For custom event handling, you can also listen to these events in your application code using standard event listeners.
