</Accordion>

Now let's start building the form, follow the steps below:
1. Surface Forms provides an initial template to start from, you can start editing the same or create new one!
    <Accordion title="Click to expand">
        <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/5.jpg" alt="Hero Light" />
    </Accordion>
2. You can see that all the form steps are listed on the left side of the form builder under `All Steps` section.
    <Accordion title="Click to expand">
        <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/6.jpg" alt="Hero Light" />
    </Accordion>
3. You can add new steps on clicking `Plus Icon` button.
4. Click `Step0` to start editing the form, Here's how it looks:
    <Accordion title="Click to expand">
        <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/7.png" alt="Hero Light" />
    </Accordion>
5. Each Step is divided into 2 tabs `Questions` and `Marketing`.
    - `Questions` tab is where you can add multiple components to the form like `Input Fields`.
    - `Marketing` tab is where you can add multiple marketing components to form.
6. Let's start by editing the header component on `Questions Panel`:
    - Click on the `Header` component and you can see the `Header` component.
        <Accordion title="Click to expand">
            <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/8.png" alt="Hero Light" />
        </Accordion>
    - As you can see, each component gives you flexibilty to edit and style the component.
    - `Header` component gives you multiple options to start with like `Logo`, `Header`, `Sub Heading`.
    - Each input field supports `rich text` to style the text.
7. Now lets edit `Marketing` panel for `step0`:
    - The `Marketing` panel gives you multiple component options for marketing like `Header`, `Images`, `Carousel`, `Logo Banner`. You can add one using `Plus Icon` button.
        <Accordion title="Click to expand">
            <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/9.png" alt="Hero Light" />
        </Accordion>
    - Let's edit `Marketing Header` component:
        - Click on the `Marketing Header` component.
        - Again you will see same layout and options like we'd on `Questions` panel.
        - This also supports `rich text` to style the text and `style` panel gives you flexibity to style the component.
8. Form Flow and Logic
    - Surface Form automatically generates form flow and logic based on the steps you've added. You can also customize the form flow and logic by clicking on the `Flow` button on the navbar.
        <Accordion title="Click to expand">
            <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/10.png" alt="Hero Light" />
        </Accordion>
### 6. Save and Share 
    Change the form name on the `navbar` and Save the form by clicking on the `Save` button.
    Share the form using `Share` button on the navbar.
    - You can share the form using the `Share Link` or `Embed Code` to embed the form on your website.
        <Accordion title="Click to expand">
            <img className="block" src="/images/first-form/11.png" alt="Hero Light" />
