# Surface Labs Onboarding Guide

Complete these steps to fully activate and integrate Surface Labs into your workflow.

## Step 1: Integrate Your Website

Connect Surface Labs to your website traffic to start revealing visitors. Choose one of the following methods:

  <Card title="Website Tag (Recommended)" href="/developers/intent-client/website-tag" icon="icon-tag">
    Add the Surface Labs JavaScript snippet to your website with minimal setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Integration" href="/developers/intent-client/overview#installation" icon="icon-code">
    Install the Surface Labs Intent client in your web app for full customizability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Segment Integration" href="/reference/integrations/segment" icon="icon-segment">
    Connect your existing Segment subscription to send traffic to Surface Labs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Typically, this integration is owned by your engineering or marketing team.

## Step 2: Turn on Intent Data

Enable intent data to start identifying the companies behind anonymous website traffic. Surface Labs provides intent data out of the box with no additional configuration:

  Activate high-coverage website identification with Surface Labs Intent.
</Card>

If you use another intent data provider, you can connect your own API key in seconds:

  </Card>

    Leverage 6sense intent data within Surface Labs.
  </Card>
